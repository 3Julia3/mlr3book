# Model Interpretation {#interpretation .unnumbered}

{{< include _setup.qmd >}}

In principle, all generic frameworks for model interpretation are applicable on the models fitted with `r mlr3book::mlr_pkg("mlr3")` by just extracting the fitted models from the `r ref("Learner")` objects.

However, two of the most popular frameworks,

* `r mlr3book::cran_pkg("iml")` in @sec-iml,
* `r mlr3book::cran_pkg("DALEX")` in @sec-dalex, and

additionally come with some convenience for `r mlr3book::mlr_pkg("mlr3")`.
