The Graphs seen so far all have a linear structure.
Some POs may have multiple input or output channels.
These channels make it possible to create non-linear Graphs with alternative paths taken by the data.

Possible types are:

- [Branching](#pipe-model-ensembles-branching-copying):
  Splitting of a node into several paths, e.g. useful when comparing multiple feature-selection methods (pca, filters).
  Only one path will be executed.
- [Copying](#pipe-model-ensembles-branching-copying):
  Splitting of a node into several paths, all paths will be executed (sequentially).
  Parallel execution is not yet supported.
- [Stacking](#pipe-model-ensembles-stacking):
  Single graphs are stacked onto each other, i.e. the output of one `r ref("Graph")` is the input for another.
  In machine learning this means that the prediction of one `r ref("Graph")` is used as input for another `r ref("Graph")`
