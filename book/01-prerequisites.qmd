# Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

This book concerns itself with machine learning ("ML"), a vast topic that encompasses many different areas. While it would be out of scope to given an introduction to the topic of ML itself (at this point we recommend our [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://slds-lmu.github.io/i2ml/) undergraduate level course available for free online), we will give a short recap of relevant topics here.

## Datasets, Models and Predictions

Supervised machine learning concerns itself with relationships that can be expressed as data. Possible examples are the relationship of engine characteristics with gas mileages in cars, the flower shapes of different kinds of plants, or the relationships between symptoms and progressions of different kinds of diseases. When these relationships are patterns in repeatable processes that happen somewhat independently of each other, then one can try to fit *models* that make *predictions* about yet unseen occurrences of these relationships based on data that was previously collected, the *training data*. These models then use some of the recorded variables, which we call *features*, to make predictions about a certain outcome, which we call the *target* variable.

While training data could be any kind of unstructured data such as images, videos, or sound files, in this book we will concern ourselves with how to apply `mlr3` to *tabular data*. This data is organized in such a way that it is contained in an `R` `data.frame` or `data.table`, with one row for each training example, and one column for each feature, as well as for the target.
