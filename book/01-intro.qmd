# Introduction and Overview {.unnumbered}

{{< include _setup.qmd >}}

The package `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` [@mlr3] and its [ecosystem](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki/Extension-Packages) provide a generic, object-oriented, and extensible framework for [classification](#tasks), [regression](#tasks), [survival analysis](#survival), and other machine learning tasks for the R language [@R].
This unified interface provides functionality to extend and combine existing [learners](#learners), intelligently select and tune the most appropriate technique for a [task](#tasks), and perform large-scale comparisons that enable meta-learning.
Examples of this advanced functionality include [hyperparameter tuning](#tuning) and [feature selection](#fs).
[Parallelization](#parallelization) of many operations is natively supported.

:::{.callout-note}
We do not implement any [learners](#learners) ourselves but provide a unified interface to many existing learners in R.

## Target Audience

`r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` provides a domain-specific language for machine learning in R.
We target both **practitioners** who want to quickly apply machine learning algorithms and **researchers** who want to implement, benchmark, and compare their new methods in a structured environment.

We expect that users of `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` have at least basic knowledge of machine learning and R.
The later chapters of this book describe advanced functionality that requires more advanced knowledge of both.
`r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` is suitable for complex projects that use advanced functionality as well as one-liners to prototype specific tasks quickly.

Since `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` makes use of the `r mlr_pkg("R6")` system for object oriented programming, some basic familiarity with `r mlr_pkg("R6")` is beneficial, and a [quick intro](#r6) is given in the next Chapter.
It is followed by a [short introduction](#data.table) for `r cran_pkg("data.table")`, which is used by `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` as a frequent return type.

:::{.callout-note}
The package is a rewrite of an earlier version of `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` that leverages many years of experience to provide a state-of-the-art system that is easy to use and extend.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

This book concerns itself with machine learning ("ML"), and some preliminary knowledge about the subject is assumed.
An excellent first introduction to machine learning is "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" [@james2014introduction].
It fits particularly well since it has code examples in R (albeit not using `mlr3`).

Another option that covers fewer actual ML algorithms, and instead focuses more on the learning problem itself, is "Learning From Data" [@learning_from_data] which is the accompanying book of the [free Caltech "Learning from Data" online course](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse).
`mlr3` treats ML algorithms as black boxes, so this option may be more efficient; however, some topics such as ROC-curves or model ensembles are missing.

Other popular works that give very thorough introductions to machine learning, including many algorithms, are "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop, and "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman.
The latter is more statistical in nature and may require more knowledge of statistics as a prerequisite.

There is also a free online [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://slds-lmu.github.io/i2ml/) undergraduate level course by the authors of this book.
Because of this fact, its use of terminology and concepts overlap with this book and complement it well.

## Why a Rewrite?

`r mlr_pkg("mlr")` [@mlr] was first released to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) in 2013, with the core design and architecture dating back much further.
Over time, the addition of many features has led to a considerably more complex design that made it harder to build, maintain, and extend than we had hoped for.
With hindsight, we saw that some design and architecture choices in `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` made it difficult to support new features, in particular with respect to pipelines.
Furthermore, the R ecosystem as well as helpful packages such as `r cran_pkg("data.table")` have undergone major changes in the meantime.

It would have been nearly impossible to integrate all of these changes into the original design of `r mlr_pkg("mlr")`.
Instead, we decided to start working on a reimplementation in 2018, which resulted in the first release of `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` on CRAN in July 2019.
The new design and the integration of further and newly-developed R packages (especially `r cran_pkg("R6")`, `r cran_pkg("future")`, and `r cran_pkg("data.table")`) makes `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` much easier to use, maintain, and in many regards more efficient compared to its predecessor `r mlr_pkg("mlr")`.

## Design Principles

We follow these general design principles in the `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` package and ecosystem.

* **Backend over frontend**.
  Most packages of the `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` ecosystem focus on processing and transforming data, applying machine learning algorithms, and computing results.
  Our core packages do not provide a graphical user interfaces (GUIs) whose dependencies would make an installation on a computing server unnecassary tedious; visualizations of data and results are provided in extra packages like `r mlr_pkg("mlr3viz")`. `r cran_pkg("mlr3shiny")` provides an interface for some basic machine learning tasks using the `r cran_pkg("shiny")` package.
* **Object oriientation**. Embrace `r cran_pkg("R6")` for a clean, object-oriented design, object state-changes, and reference semantics.
* **Tabular data**. Embrace `r cran_pkg("data.table")` for fast and convenient computations on tabular data.
* **Unify container and result classes** as much as possible and provide result data in `data.table`s.
    This considerably simplifies the API and allows easy selection and "split-apply-combine" (aggregation) operations.
    We combine `data.table` and `R6` to place references to non-atomic and compound objects in tables and make heavy use of list columns.
* **Defensive programming and type safety**.
  All user input is checked with [`checkmate`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=checkmate) [@checkmate].
  Return types are documented, and mechanisms popular in base R which "simplify" the result unpredictably (e.g., `sapply()` or the `drop` argument for indexing data.frames) are avoided.
* **Be light on dependencies**.
  One of the main maintenance burdens for `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` was to keep up with changing learner interfaces and behavior of the many packages it depended on.
  We require far fewer packages in `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` to make installation and maintenance easier.

## Package Ecosystem

`r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` builds upon the following packages not developed by core members of the `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` team:

  * `r cran_pkg("R6")`:
    Reference class objects.
  * `r cran_pkg("data.table")`:
    Extension of R's `data.frame`.
  * `r cran_pkg("digest")`:
    Hash digests.
  * `r cran_pkg("uuid")`:
    Unique string identifiers.
  * `r cran_pkg("lgr")`:
    Logging facility.
  * `r cran_pkg("mlbench")`:
    A collection of machine learning data sets.
  * `r cran_pkg("evaluate")`:
    For [capturing output, warnings, and exceptions](#error-handling).
  * `r cran_pkg("future")` / `r cran_pkg("future.apply")`:
    For [parallelization](#parallelization).

All these packages are well curated and mature; we expect no problems with dependencies.

The `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` package itself provides the base functionality that the rest of ecosystem rely on and some fundamental building blocks for machine learning.
The following packages extend `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` with capabilities for preprocessing, pipelining, visualizations, additional learners, additional task types, and more:

```{r 01-intro-001, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="98%", eval=knitr::is_html_output()}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlr-org/mlr3/master/man/figures/mlr3verse.svg")
```

```{asis 01-intro-001a, include=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis'}
