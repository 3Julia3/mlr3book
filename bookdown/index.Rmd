# Prerequisites

To get all required packages to run all examples in this book, install the `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3book")`  package using the `r cran_pkg("remotes")` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("mlr-org/mlr3book", dependencies = TRUE)
```

After the installation, load the `mlr3` package and you are good to go:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(mlr3)
```
